This is a troll application that turns wasd into a sound button.
You can changee the sounds do any thing that you want(Has to be .wav).
To do this you first have to delete the old music files and rename them to their correct names.

What this does is create a loop then is says that whenever w, a, s or d is pressed to play a specific sound effect
